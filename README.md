## About the Project

This research project aims to investigate the impact of work from home arrangements on wage structures. We employ both empirical analysis of real-world data and a structural model to capture the underlying economic mechanisms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies (list to be provided)
3. Explore the data in the `data/` directory
4. Run scripts in the `src/` directory for analysis
