## Overall Improvement Tasks

-  **Clarify unique contribution.**
	 - [ ] Emphasize if and why introducing occupation controls is novel and how it rules out alternative explanations. ðŸ†” PW5dtA

-  **Streamline the modelâ€™s narrative.**
	- [ ] Clearly explain the shift from vacancy-based wages to the mechanism where higher ability drives the decision to WFH.   ðŸ†” 3QcNHl
	 - [ ] Illustrate the role of key parameters (  andÂ ) and explore alternative calibrations. ðŸ†” uDyW3B

-  **Simplify technical details.**  
	- [ ] Use a concrete example or diagram to explain your teleworkability index and the use of machine learning.   ðŸ†” kFtP5d
	- Focus on the main insights rather than overwhelming technical details.

 - **Refine survey and data discussion.**  
	- [ ] Clarify how work-from-home is measured, accounting for hybrid arrangements, and discuss the limitations of binary measures like the Dingel-Neiman index. ðŸ†” L1C9yv

-  **Address potential heterogeneity.**  
	- [ ] Explain how the model separates the premium due to teleworkability from that of higher productivity and inherent abilities.   ðŸ†” J3rCoz
	- [ ] Ensure that both observable and unobservable differences across workers and occupations are covered. ðŸ†” COKbCY

## Concrete Questions to Answer

1.  Am I the first to incorporate occupation dummies in a WFH wage regression, and what evidence supports that?  
2. What is the precise mechanism by which higher ability leads to both a higher likelihood of WFH and a wage premium?  
3. How do alternative calibrations affect the equilibrium wages for workers with different abilities?  
4. How accurately do survey measures capture hybrid work arrangements versus a strict binary interpretation?  
5. In what ways does my index improve upon existing measures like the Dingel-Neiman index?  
6. How can I isolate the effect of teleworkability from the influence of worker productivity or cognitive skills?
