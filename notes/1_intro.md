In the United States, working from home is associated with higher real hourly wages [@gariety2007wage], [@holgersen2021and]. From 2013 to 2019, the real wage ratio of WFH employees to non-WFH employees remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly between 1.35 and 1.40. This suggests that on average, remote employees earned about 35 40\% more than their on-site counterparts during these years. However, in 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated shift to remote work due to health restrictions, the wage ratio began to increase significantly. The ratio peaked in 2021 at approximately 1.6, indicating that the average real hourly wage for remote employees was about 60\% higher than that for on-site employees. This surge could reflect changes in the dynamics of the labor market, such as increased demand for remote-capable jobs, changes in job composition, or changes in the types of occupations more suited to remote work. In 2022, the wage ratio showed a slight decline, but it remained elevated compared to the pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a lasting impact on wage structures between remote and non-remote workers. 


Why is the average real hourly wage higher for remote employees? According to the compensating wage differential theory, if working from home is considered an amenity, then wages should be lower for remote employees. [@mas2017valuing] found that, on average, job applicants are willing to accept an 8 percent reduction in wages for the opportunity to work from home.

In contrast, the productivity argument suggests that wages are positively correlated with employee productivity. If working from home increases employees' labor productivity, then the wage rate should be higher for remote employees compared to on-site employees. Productivity improvements may stem from factors such as the elimination of commuting and fatigue from traffic, as well as reduced social distractions from chatting with co-workers and colleagues. [@bloom2015does] conducted a randomized WFH experiment at a Chinese travel agency called Ctrip and found that working from home led to a 13\% increase in performance. [@davis2021work] have found that relative total factor productivity (TFP) of WFH must have increased by 48\% for low-skill workers and 82\% for high-skill workers to rationalize the fourfold increase in days worked from home after the COVID-19 pandemic. This could explain the increasing gap in wages for remote and non-remote employees, but it doesn't explain the existence of this gap.

To investigate the potential reasons for the observed WFH wage premium and its relationship with worker skills and occupational characteristics, we develop a structural model based on the directed search framework [@menzio2010a]. This framework is particularly well-suited to our research question because it explicitly models the labor market as a collection of submarkets defined by the utility (incorporating both wage and remote work flexibility) offered to workers. By incorporating heterogeneity in both worker skill and firm remote work efficiency, the model allows us to analyze how these factors interact with firms' optimal choices of utility offers and workers' optimal search strategies. This structure enables us to explore how sorting dynamics – the matching of specific worker types with specific firm types in particular submarkets – can generate wage differentials and remote work patterns consistent with the empirical evidence, providing insights beyond reduced-form regressions.

In our study, we first empirically test the hypothesis that a significant positive difference exists between wages for remote and on-site employees. We refer to this positive gap as the work-from-home premium. Using data from the American Community Survey (2013-2023), we show that, after controlling for education, age, race, industry, occupation, year and place of residence, the WFH premium is around 10\%.

Our model analyzes how remote work affects wages using a **directed search framework**, inspired by [@menzio2010a]. In this setup, the labor market isn't a single pool; instead, it's divided into many "submarkets," each defined by the specific level of utility (a combination of wage and remote work flexibility) offered to a particular type of worker. Workers, knowing their own skill level, choose which submarket (which utility offer) to search in to maximize their chances of getting a good job quickly. Firms, knowing the type of worker they want to hire, decide which utility level to promise in their job postings to attract those workers efficiently. This directed search approach allows us to explicitly model how different firms compete for different workers by offering distinct contracts (utility levels) and how this competition shapes wages and job-finding rates across the market, reflecting the idea that workers actively seek out jobs that best match their preferences and skills, rather than randomly bumping into employers.

Our study relates to two strands of literature. The COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions have sparked discussions on various topics, including the impact of working from home (WFH) on cities, work arrangements, and the housing market. Our paper focuses on studies examining WFH trends. In 2023, the share of full days worked from home was four times greater than in the year before the pandemic of 2019 [@barrero2023evolution]. Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2023) discuss how COVID-19 accelerated the shift to WFH and why it is likely to persist. [@davis2021work] attribute the increase in WFH days to a significant rise in the productivity of WFH technology—48\% for low-skill workers and 83\% for high-skill workers.

Another strand of literature explores the relationship between remote work arrangements and wages. [@gariety2007wage] empirically test the existence of a wage differential associated with working from home and find that it is associated with higher wages than traditional on-site work. [@mas2017valuing] estimated employees' willingness to pay for alternative work arrangements, such as flexible scheduling, working from home, and positions with employer discretion over scheduling. They conducted a discrete choice experiment during the job application process for a national call center and found that working from home was the most valued option among employees. On average, job applicants were willing to accept a 8\% reduction in wages to take advantage of the opportunity to work from home.

Our study aims to contribute to this literature by examining the potential reasons for the wage gap between remote and non-remote employees. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes the empirical motivation for our study, presenting stylized facts about remote work, wages, and skills using data from the ACS, O\*NET, and BLS, and highlighting the correlation between remote work/teleworkability and higher wages. Section 3 develops our theoretical framework, a directed search model incorporating heterogeneity in worker skill ($h$) and firm remote work efficiency ($\psi$), and derives the optimal remote work policy. Section 4 details the estimation and calibration strategy, including the construction of our Teleworkability Index, the econometric estimation of production function components, and the calibration of the model's remaining parameters and distributions using external data and literature values. Section 5 presents the key qualitative results from simulating the calibrated model, focusing on its predictions for sorting, wages, remote work patterns, and market outcomes. Section 6 concludes. Technical derivations and the equilibrium computation algorithm are detailed in the Appendix.
