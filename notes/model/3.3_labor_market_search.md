### Labor Market Search

Both firms and workers discount the future at rate $\beta$. Workers are characterized by their type $h$ and direct their search toward submarkets distinguished by the promised utility level $x$. A worker of type $h$ evaluates the different utility promises available in each submarket and chooses to search in the one that maximizes their expected value. This expected value incorporates not only the probability of being hired but also the future discounted value of the job. At the same time, firms target workers of a particular type $h$ by posting job offers (or contracts) that promise a specific utility level $x$. This setup allows the market to be segmented into different submarkets. The tightness of a submarket $(h, x)$  is defined as:$$
\theta(h, x) = \frac{v(h, x)}{u(h, x)},$$where $v(h, x)$ denotes the number of vacancies posted by firms in the submarket and $u(h, x)$ represents the number of unemployed workers actively searching within that particular submarket. This measure of tightness directly influences the probabilities of matching: the vacancy filling rate $q(\theta(h, x))$ and the job finding rate $p(\theta(h, x))$ are both functions of $\theta$. In our equilibrium, free entry of firms ensures that the expected profit from posting a vacancy is zero, after incurring a cost $\kappa\in\mathbb{R}_{++}$. Matches are exogenously broken at a rate $\delta$.

Once a firm and a worker are matched, the firm delivers the promised utility $x$ to the worker by applying the firm's optimal remote work policy. Before posting vacancies, firms face uncertainty about their remote-work efficiency parameter $\psi$. However, the distribution $F(\psi)$ is common knowledge among all agents in the economy. Because firms are ex-ante identical in this dimension, any worker searching in a given submarket faces the same probability of being matched with a firm having a particular productivity level $\psi$.

For firms, the value of posting a vacancy in a submarket characterized by $(h, x)$ is given by$$
V(h, x) = -\kappa + q(\theta(h,x))\int J(\psi, h, x)\, dF(\psi),
$$ {#eq-valueFirmEntry}
where $\kappa$ is the vacancy posting cost and $J(\psi, h, x)$ is the value from an ongoing match with a firm of productivity $\psi$. The match value is determined by the current payoff—expressed as the output minus the wage cost plus the discounted expected continuation value:$$
J(\psi, h, x) = Y\bigl(\alpha^*(\psi, h)\mid \psi, h\bigr) - w\bigl(x, \alpha^*(\psi, h)\bigr) + \beta\Bigl[(1-\delta) J(\psi, h, x) + \delta\, V(h, x)\Bigr].
$$ {#eq-valueFirmMatch}

Notice that free-entry guarantee that $V(h,x)=0$, this means that the  value function described in @eq-valueFirmMatch can be computed independently of the distributions of workers and vacancies across submarkets. Furthermore the value of matches pin-down the meeting rates and thus the submarket tightness. Notice that free entry condition is binding if the submarket is active in equilibrium (i.e. $\theta(h,x)>0$), then from @eq-valueFirmEntry:$$\theta(h,x) = q^{-1}\left(\frac{\kappa}{\int J(\psi, h, x)\, dF(\psi)}\right) \quad \text{ if } \theta(h,x)>0$${#eq-submarketTightnessPinDownEquation}
For workers, the value functions capture the trade-off between being unemployed and employed. The value of unemployment for a worker of type $h$ is$$
U(h) = b + \max_{x} \Biggl\{ p\bigl(\theta(h,x)\bigr) \int W(\psi, h, x)\, dF(\psi) + \Bigl(1 - p\bigl(\theta(h,x)\bigr)\Bigr) U(h)\Biggr\},$${#eq-unemployedWorkerValue}
where $b$ denotes the unemployment benefit. Once employed, the worker's value is given by$$
W(\psi, h, x) = x + \beta\Bigl[(1-\delta)W(\psi, h, x) + \delta\,U(h)\Bigr].$${#eq-employedWorkerValue}
This recursive formulation encapsulates the idea that a worker receives the promised utility $x$ while also facing the possibility of job separation.
