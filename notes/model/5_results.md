This section presents the key qualitative predictions generated by simulating our directed search model, using the parameters and distributions estimated and calibrated as detailed in Section 4. We focus on how the interplay between worker skill ($h$), firm remote work efficiency ($\psi$), utility-dependent posting costs ($\kappa(x)$), and probabilistic firm choices shapes labor market outcomes.

**Worker Search Behavior:**
The model predicts workers' optimal search strategies across utility submarkets. Figure @fig-worker_search_policy plots the optimal promised utility level $x^*(h)$ targeted by workers of different skill levels $h$. Consistent with intuition, higher-skilled workers, who generate more value in matches, direct their search towards submarkets offering higher lifetime utility. This reflects their ability to command better compensation packages, which include both wages and remote work flexibility.


This confirms that the model generates sorting where more efficient firms compete for more skilled workers by offering more attractive utility packages.

**Expected Wages and Remote Work:**
The sorting patterns translate into equilibrium wage and remote work outcomes. Figure @fig-expected_outcomes plots the expected wage $\mathbb{E}[w | h, x^*(h)]$ and expected remote work share $\mathbb{E}[\alpha^* | h, x^*(h)]$ for workers across the skill distribution, calculated using the conditional distribution of firms $f^*(\psi | h, x^*(h))$ in their optimally chosen submarket $x^*(h)$. As expected, higher-skilled workers command significantly higher wages. Furthermore, the expected share of remote work $\alpha^*$ also increases with worker skill $h$. This arises because higher-$h$ workers sort into markets with higher-$\psi$ firms, and these firms, being more efficient at remote work, optimally offer a greater share of remote time ($\alpha^*$) as part of the utility package $x^*(h)$.

**Market Outcomes: Job Finding Rates:**
Figure @fig-job_finding_prob illustrates the equilibrium job-finding probability $p(\theta^*(h, x))$ faced by workers in different submarkets. While multiple markets might be theoretically available, workers concentrate their search in the market $x^*(h)$ offering the highest expected value. The plot shows $p(\theta^*(h, x))$ across the range of potential utility offers $x$ for representative low, medium, and high-skilled workers. We observe that for each skill level, the job-finding probability decreases as the offered utility $x$ increases, reflecting the higher cost and potentially lower equilibrium $q^*$ in higher-utility markets. However, higher-skilled workers can access markets with higher utility levels before the job-finding probability drops to zero, consistent with their higher market value.


**Summary of Results:**
The simulated model, parameterized using our empirical strategy, successfully generates key qualitative features consistent with labor market observations. It produces positive assortative matching between worker skill and firm efficiency, mediated through directed search over utility offers. This sorting leads to higher-skilled workers targeting and receiving higher utility offers, which translates into higher expected wages and a greater expected share of remote work. The model highlights how firm heterogeneity in remote work efficiency and utility-dependent posting costs can shape equilibrium wages and work arrangements.
