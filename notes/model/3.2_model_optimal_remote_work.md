### Optimal Remote Work Choice
The firm’s problem implies an optimal choice of remote work $\alpha^*(\psi, h, x)$ that satisfies the first-order condition:

**Interior Solution:** Let's start with the interior solution, where the firm chooses a positive fraction of remote work. This optimal choice $\alpha^*(\psi, h, x)$ must satisfy:
1. **First Order Condition:**
$$A(h)\,\big(g(\psi,h)-1\big) = -\frac{u_\alpha\big(w(\alpha^*),\alpha^*\big)}{u_w\big(w(\alpha^*),\alpha^*\big)}.$$ {#eq-interiorSolutionOptimalRemote}
2. **Promise Keeping Constraint:**$$
    x = u(w(\alpha^*),\alpha^*).$$ {#eq-promiseKeepingConstraint}

The assumptions $u_w > 0$ and $u_\alpha > 0$ ensure that the utility function is strictly increasing in the wage argument and continuously differentiable, which in turn guarantees that the inversion $w(\alpha) = u^{-1}(x,\alpha)$ is well defined and unique. Details of the derivation are on [Appendix @sec-appendix-remote-policy-general]

**Economic Interpretation:** The term $A(h)\,\big(g(\psi,h)-1\big)$ represents the marginal change in production when increasing the share of remote work $\alpha$. In particular, if remote work is less productive (i.e., $g(\psi,h) < 1$), then increasing $\alpha$ improves output; otherwise, the opposite is true. The term $u_\alpha/u_w$ represents the trade-off from the worker's utility perspective, indicating how much the wage can be reduced (in marginal terms) for an increase in $\alpha$ while still maintaining the worker’s promised utility level $x$. The firm chooses $\alpha$ such that the marginal benefit from the production side exactly offsets the marginal saving in wage cost, as captured by the worker's indifference curve. Importantly, no assumption is made the magnitude of $g(\psi, h)$. Should remote work be more productive for any worker skill level ($g(\psi, h) > 1$), the firm optimally selects a corner solution with $\alpha=1$. This arises because the marginal benefit from increasing $\alpha$ includes both enhanced production _and_ potential wage savings ($u_\alpha/u_w > 0$). Consequently, the trade-off described earlier—balancing potential output changes against wage cost adjustments—no longer constrains the firm from maximizing remote work.

**Corner Solution:** Notice that @eq-interiorSolutionOptimalRemote describes only the interior solutions. The firm may also choose to offer either full remote work ($\alpha = 1$) or no remote work $(\alpha = 0)$. The conditions for these corner solutions are as follows:

- \[$\underline{\psi}(h)$\] *Threshold for Offering Some Remote Work ($\alpha^*>0$):*$$g(\underline{\psi}(h),h)=1-\frac{1}{A(h)}\left[\frac{u_\alpha\big(w(0),0\big)}{u_w\big(w(0),0\big)}\right]$$ {#eq-lower-threshold}
- \[$\overline{\psi}(h)$\] *Threshold for Full Remote Work ($\alpha^*=1$):*$$g(\overline{\psi}(h),h)=1-\frac{1}{A(h)}\left[\frac{u_\alpha\big(w(1),1\big)}{u_w\big(w(1),1\big)}\right]$$ {#eq-upper-threshold}

Both thresholds are obtained by evaluating $$\frac{d\Pi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}\Big|_{\alpha=0} \qquad \text{and} \qquad  \frac{d\Pi(\alpha)}{d\alpha}\Big|_{\alpha=1}$${#eq-thresholds-conditions-evaluatio}
the idea is to find for each skill level the region in the remote productivity space where even a slight deviation in remote work (from full remote or full in person) do not increase profits from the firm. Details on [Appendix @sec-appendix-remote-policy-general]

The optimal remote work policy is given by: $$\alpha^*(\psi, h, x) = \begin{cases}
    \hspace{1cm} 0 & \text{if} \quad \psi \leq \underline{\psi}(h) \\
    \alpha^*(\psi, h, x) &  \text{if} \quad \underline{\psi}(h) < \psi < \overline{\psi}(h) \\
    \hspace{1cm} 1 & \text{if} \quad \overline{\psi}(h) \leq \psi
\end{cases}$$ {#eq-optimalRemoteWorkPolicy}
The interior solution $\alpha^*(\psi, h, x)$ satisfies the first-order condition in @eq-interiorSolutionOptimalRemote.

**Properties of the Optimal Remote Policy**

1. If an increase in worker skill $h$ raises remote productivity by more than it raises baseline productivity. In other words, then the interior solution $\alpha^*(h)$ increases with $h$ (firms offer more remote work to more skilled workers). At the same time, the thresholds $\underline{\psi}(h)$ and $\overline{\psi}(h)$, decrease with worker skill; meaning that the requirements on firm remote productivity for offering some (and full) remote work are lower.
2. If an increase in worker skill $h$ raises remote productivity and baseline productivity equally at the margin, then the interior solution $\alpha^*(h)$ is constant with respect to $h$. The thresholds $\underline{\psi}(h)$ and $\overline{\psi}(h)$ are locally invariant (flat) with respect to worker skill.
3. If an increase in worker skill $h$ raises baseline productivity more than remote productivity, then the interior solution $\alpha^*(h)$ decreases with $h$ higher worker skill implies lower remote work. The thresholds $\underline{\psi}(h)$ and $\overline{\psi}(h)$ increase with worker skill; meaning that the requirements on firm remote productivity for offering some (and full) remote work are higher.

#### Parametric Example

In this example, we detail a specific parameterization that illustrates the general structure of our model. The productivity function is given by$$
A(h)=A_0+A_1h,$${#eq-prod-skill-example}
with the assumption that $A'(h)=A_1>0$, ensuring that productivity increases with skill level $h$. Here, $A_0$ represents the base level of productivity common to all workers, while $A_1$ captures the incremental productivity gain associated with an increase in worker skill $h$. This linear form reflects the idea that more skilled workers generate higher baseline output in a proportional manner.

The effectiveness of remote work is modeled as$$
g(\psi,h)=\psi-\psi_0+\phi\log(h) \quad \text{ with }\phi\ge0.$${#eq-remote-efficiency-example}
$\psi_0$ serves as a baseline adjustment factor that reflects the overall conduciveness of the technological environment to remote work. For example, improvements in communication technologies effectively lower $\psi_0$, thereby reducing the productivity losses typically associated with remote work arrangements for all possible worker-firms pairs. The term $\phi \log(h)$ captures the impact of worker skill on remote work productivity. The parameter $\phi \ge 0$ measures the sensitivity to skill—higher values of $\phi$ indicate that increases in worker skill more strongly enhance remote work efficiency. Importantly, the logarithmic transformation implies diminishing marginal returns to skill in this context, capturing the idea that initial improvements in $h$ yield larger efficiency gains compared to later ones.
Worker utility is specified by$$
U(w,\alpha)=a_0+a_1w-c_0(1-\alpha)^\chi,$${#eq-utility-function}
with parameters satisfying $a_1>0$, $c_0>0$, and $\chi>1$. This formulation guarantees that utility increases with the remote work share $\alpha$ and that the marginal trade-off ratio is rising in $\alpha$. 

Given these functional forms, a higher worker skill $h$ enhances both baseline productivity and the effectiveness of remote work. Consequently, as $h$ increases, the model predicts a higher optimal remote work share, $\alpha^*$, under sufficiently efficient remote work conditions. Calibrating parameters such as $A_0$, $A_1$, and $\phi$ enables us to match observed patterns in remote work adoption: a higher $\phi$ would suggest that increases in worker skill substantially lower the efficiency threshold required for firms to adopt remote work, shifting the choice of $\alpha^*$ upward.

The firm's profit maximization problem, subject to a fixed utility level for the worker, leads to the following optimal remote work share:$$\alpha^{*}(\psi,h,x)=\begin{cases}
		0 & \text{if } \psi \leq \underline{\psi}(h), \\
		1-\left[\frac{a_1A(h)(1-g(\psi,h))}{c_0\chi}\right]^{\frac{1}{\chi-1}} & \text{if } \underline{\psi}(h) < \psi < \overline{\psi}(h), \\
		1 & \text{if } \overline{\psi}(h) \leq \psi,
\end{cases}$${#eq-remote-policy-example}
With:$$\overline{\psi}(h)=1+\psi_0-\phi\log(h),
\qquad \text{and}\qquad \underline{\psi}(h)=1+\psi_0-\phi\log(h)-\frac{c_0\chi}{a_1(A_0+A_1h)}.$${#eq-remote-thresholds-example}
Regarding their monotonicity in $h$, if $\phi=0$ the upper threshold remains constant, but if $\phi>0$, $\overline{\psi}(h)$ is strictly decreasing. In contrast, with $\phi=0$, the lower threshold $\underline{\psi}(h)$ increases with $h$. When $\phi>0$, the monotonicity of $\underline{\psi}(h)$ depends on the value of $A_0$. If $A_0=0$, $\underline{\psi}(h)$ increases for $h<\hat{h}$ and decreases for $h>\hat{h}$, where $$
\hat{h}=\frac{c_0\chi}{\phi a_1A_1}.$${#eq-hat-h-one-root}
For $A_0>0$, if $c_0\chi\le4\phi a_1A_0$, $\underline{\psi}(h)$ is strictly decreasing; if $c_0\chi>4\phi a_1A_0$, it decreases for $h\in(0,\hat{h}_{1})$, increases for $h\in(\hat{h}_1,\hat{h}_2)$, and decreases again for $h>\hat{h}_2$, with the turning points determined by $$
\hat{h}_{1,2}=\frac{(c_0\chi-2\phi a_1A_0)\pm\sqrt{c_0\chi(c_0\chi-4\phi a_1A_0)}}{2\phi a_1A_1}.$${#eq-hat-h-two-roots}

![Lower $(\underline{\psi}(h))$ and upper $\overline{\psi}(h)$ thresholds variation with worker skill.](figures/model_figures/plot_thresholds.pdf){#fig-elephant width=65%}

@fig-elephant provides a graphical representation of the thresholds for a parametrization with $A_{0} = 0$. The declining curves of $\underline{\psi}(h)$ and $\overline{\psi}(h)$ with higher worker skill indicate that, as employees become more skilled, firms are more likely to adopt remote work policies even when their efficiency levels are moderate. This further underscores the importance of skill in determining the mix of remote versus in-person work.


![Optimal remote work share $(\alpha^{*})$ for different remote efficiency and skill levels.](/figures/model_figures/plot_policy_for_skill.pdf){#fig-el width=65%}

@fig-el, shows the optimal remote work share $\alpha^*$ as a function of firm remote work efficiency $\psi$ across different worker skill levels $h$. The graph delineates regions where the optimal $\alpha^*$ takes on the values 0 (in-person work), between 0 and 1 (partial remote work), and 1 (full remote work). Notably, higher worker skill shifts the transition thresholds, implying that more skilled workers require lower firm efficiency to justify a shift towards remote work. The chosen parametrization guarantees that the interior solution $\alpha^*(h)$ increases with $h$.
