**ai**: This paper provides a comprehensive look into how Bartik instruments work, their identification assumptions, and practical issues in their application. In essence, a Bartik instrument is constructed by interacting local industry shares (which measure exposure) with national (or aggregate) industry growth rates (which provide the “shock”). The authors show that:

1. The commonly used Bartik approach can be viewed as a pooled exposure design. In this view, the instrument’s identifying assumption is that—conditional on observable controls—the variation in industry shares used to form the instrument is uncorrelated with other shocks that might also affect outcomes. In other words, it is the differential exposure across locations (through fixed local shares) to common national shocks that drives identification.

2. There is a formal equivalence between the two‐stage least squares (TSLS) estimator using a single Bartik instrument and a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator that uses the underlying industry shares as separate instruments with a particular weighting. In this decomposition, the “Rotemberg weights” reveal which industries contribute most to the overall estimate and how sensitive the final result is to possible misspecification in those industry-specific comparisons.

3. The paper details the conditions under which the Bartik estimator is consistent. In settings with few industries the identification is best interpreted in terms of the exogeneity of the shares (much like a difference‐in‐differences design), whereas if many industries are available one might also rely on the “shocks” being exogenous. The authors explain that whichever interpretation a researcher takes, it is crucial to examine whether the industry shares correlate with other factors that might affect the outcome.

4. The authors discuss how the overall estimator mixes together the “just‐identified” estimates from each industry using the Rotemberg weights. This framework makes it possible to diagnose empirically which industries drive the estimates and to test the plausibility of the underlying assumptions—for example, by checking correlates of the shares or assessing pre-trends if a panel pre‐treatment period exists.

5. The paper also explores heterogeneous effects. When treatment effects vary across locations, different industries may yield different local estimates; if some industries even receive negative weights, the Bartik estimator might not reflect a simple local average treatment effect (LATE). The authors propose visual diagnostics (e.g. plotting individual industry estimates against first‐stage strength) as well as alternative estimators and overidentification tests that help researchers assess robustness and address potential misspecification.

Through formal derivations, asymptotic results, and a decomposition of the estimator, the paper provides both a theoretical framework and practical tools that guide applied researchers. They illustrate their results with applications such as estimating the elasticity of labor supply and the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives, and they briefly discuss related applications (like studying the impact of Chinese import shocks or bank lending shocks). Ultimately, the paper encourages researchers to be explicit about whether their identification comes from differential exposure (via industry shares) or exogenous shocks, and to use the provided diagnostics to bolster the credibility of their empirical designs.

**user**: let me describe my problem:

I have wprkers that work remote or not and in another dataset i have workers and a more nunaced measure of hybryd work. the problem is that were i dont have hybrid i have better occupation infomation. I would like to use a bartik like approach to try to estimate those sharesof "hybrid" find in this paper enything that could be usful

**ai**: One way to think about your problem using a Bartik‐like approach is to mimic the two key ingredients of the Bartik instrument:

1. Differential exposure (the “shares”): In your case, these could be the pre‐determined occupational composition measures that vary across locations (or worker groups). Even if the data with better occupation information does not directly provide a measure of hybrid work, it does give you a good proxy for the “exposure” of a location (or sub‐group) to hybrid work potential.

2. The common shock (the “growth” component): Here you could use your second dataset—the one with the more nuanced measure of hybrid work—to compute “occupation‐level” hybrid trends. For example, you might compute for each occupation the national (or aggregate) trend in hybrid work taking advantage of the richer measure.

Then the idea is to interact (or “shift”) the local occupation shares (from your dataset with better occupation information) with the occupation-level hybrid trends (from your dataset where you have a better hybrid measure). The resulting “Bartik instrument” would be:  

  Hybrid Instrumentₗ = ∑ₒ (Occupation Shareₗ₍ₒ₎ × Hybrid Trend₍ₒ₎),  

where the sum is over occupations. This instrument would represent how much a particular location (or worker group) is “exposed” to hybrid work given its occupational composition, and variation in the national hybrid trend by occupation.

A few details and useful points from the paper that could help in your application:

• Identification via Differential Exposure:  
In Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., the instrument’s power comes from exploiting heterogeneity in the exposure (industry shares) to a common shock (national industry growth rates). In your case, the idea would be analogous—using occupational shares as your exposure and hybrid work trends as the shock. The validity of your approach hinges on the assumption that these pre-determined occupational shares are exogenous to outcomes (aside from their effect through the hybrid channel).

• Timing and Pre-determined Shares:  
The paper emphasizes using shares that are fixed before the shock. You should consider using occupational composition from a pre-shock or baseline period in which the hybrid measure wasn’t yet prevalent (or measured with limited detail) to avoid endogeneity issues.

• Diagnostics and Weighting:  
The paper shows that the “Bartik estimator” is effectively a weighted average of the underlying “occupation‐specific” IV estimates, with the weights (sometimes referred to as Rotemberg weights) indicating which occupations contribute most to the identification. In your application, computing these weights could help you understand if a small handful of occupations are driving the results—and whether those occupations are plausible channels for hybrid work effects.

• Testing Plausibility:  
Following the examples in the paper, consider:
 – Checking whether the occupational shares correlate with pre-existing trends in outcomes (aside from the hybrid shock).
 – Running over-identification tests if you can set up the instrument with multiple “exposure” dimensions.
 – Visualizing the occupation-specific estimates versus their “weight” to assess potential heterogeneity, much like the pre-trend and sensitivity analyses in the paper.

In summary, you can construct a Bartik-style hybrid measure by combining (a) the exogenous occupational composition (from your dataset with better occupation detail) with (b) occupation-level hybrid work trends (from your dataset that measures hybrid work in more nuance). This approach, inspired by Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., provides a framework for estimating the local “exposure” to hybrid work—even if one dataset lacks the detailed hybrid measure, and the other dataset—even without a direct measure of hybrid work, you can use the richer occupational information to improve your estimates.

# Bartik Instruments: What, When, Why, and How

[Open in Zotero](zotero://select/items/@goldsmith-pinkhamBartikInstrumentsWhat2020)

## Summary of the Paper

- **Core Idea**:  
  The paper shows that a Bartik instrument is created by interacting local “exposure” measures (e.g. industry shares) with national “shock” measures (e.g. industry growth rates). This creates an instrument that leverages differential exposure to common shocks.

- **Identification Strategy**:  
  - The typical use assumes a *pooled exposure design*. That is, researchers use pre-determined shares that capture differential exposure across areas to a common shock, with the key identifying assumption being that these shares are exogenous with respect to other shocks affecting the outcome.  
  - For example, in their canonical application—estimating the elasticity of labor supply—the shares are fixed at a baseline period so that any subsequent outcome variation reflects the impact of the national shock rather than pre-existing differences.

- **Decomposition and Diagnostics**:  
  - The paper formally shows that the Bartik estimator is equivalent to a GMM estimator using the underlying industry shares as instruments with a certain set of weights (commonly referred to as **Rotemberg weights**).  
  - These weights help diagnose which sectors are driving the overall estimates, and they serve as a sensitivity measure to potential mis-specification of the assumptions.
  
- **Robustness and Heterogeneity**:  
  - The authors discuss how, in settings with differential or heterogeneous treatment effects, the overall estimate is a weighted average of the “just-identified” local estimates.  
  - They emphasize checking pre-trends, running over-identification tests, and considering alternative estimators as key diagnostics to assess the credibility of the research design.

## Potential Application for Estimating Hybrid Work Shares

- **Context & Data Challenges**:  
  - You have two datasets: one that identifies whether workers work remote (or not) with excellent occupational information, and a second dataset where you have a nuanced measure of hybrid work.
  - The challenge: the dataset with the nuanced hybrid measure lacks detailed occupational breakdowns, while the other has rich occupational data but only a binary remote/not indicator.

- **Bartik-Like Construction for Hybrid Work**:  
  - **Exposure Component (Shares)**:  
    Use the pre-determined occupational composition from the dataset with better occupation info as your “exposure” measure. For each location (or worker group), you can calculate the share of workers in occupation _o_.
  
  - **Shock Component (Hybrid Trends)**:  
    From the second dataset, compute the national (or aggregate) trend in hybrid work for each occupation. This provides the “shock” reflecting how hybrid work is evolving differently by occupation.
  
  - **Instrument Construction**:  
    Form a Bartik-style hybrid instrument as:  
    $$ \text{Hybrid Instrument}_l = \sum_{o} \text{Occupation Share}_{l,o} \times \text{Hybrid Trend}_o $$  
    This instrument measures the differential exposure of each location to hybrid work, as determined by its occupational composition and the common shift in hybrid work trends.

- **Key Considerations & Diagnostics (Inspired by the Paper)**:  
  - **Exogeneity of Occupational Shares**:  
    Ensure that the occupational shares are taken from a period prior to the expansion of hybrid work, or that they are otherwise plausibly exogenous to changes in hybrid work outcomes (similar to the baseline period in the paper).
    
  - **Weight Analysis**:  
    Following the approach on [Rotemberg weights](#), compute the contribution of each occupation to the overall hybrid instrument. This will help you diagnose if a few occupations dominate the instrument and whether those occupations are likely channels for the hybrid work phenomenon.
    
  - **Testing the Identification**:  
    - Check correlations between the occupation shares and other pre-existing trends or characteristics that might affect work outcomes.  
    - If possible, compare alternative estimators that use sector-specific instruments, and run overidentification tests to assess the validity of your instrument.

- **Conclusion for Your Application**:  
  By leveraging a Bartik-like strategy, you can overcome data limitations by combining the strengths of both datasets. The resulting instrument would capture how local occupational compositions predispose different areas towards hybrid work, using the nuanced hybrid trends as the common shock. This approach is directly inspired by the identification and diagnostic practices described in [[2020 - Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, Isaac Sorkin, Henry Swift - Bartik Instruments What, When, Why, and How]].
