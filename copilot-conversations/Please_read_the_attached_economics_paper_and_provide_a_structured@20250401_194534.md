**ai**: Below is a structured summary focusing on the paper's methodology:

1. Research Question & Main Hypothesis  
• The paper investigates how multidimensional skills affect workers’ on‐the‐job search, sorting into jobs, and subsequent human capital accumulation.  
• The central hypothesis is that a multidimensional view of skills—where skills accumulate when used and depreciate when idle—leads to important implications for understanding job mismatches and the sources of variation in lifetime output that a unidimensional model cannot capture.

2. Data Sources Used  
• The authors combine data from two main sources:  
  – O*NET, which provides detailed information on job skill requirements across various dimensions.  
  – The NLSY79, which offers longitudinal data on workers’ career trajectories and skill development.  

3. Empirical or Theoretical Model Employed  
• The paper develops a structural model of on-the-job search where workers differ across several skill dimensions.  
• In this model, workers sort themselves into jobs that require different combinations of skills.  
• Skills evolve over time—being accumulated through usage and depreciating when not applied—which is central to understanding career dynamics and the cost of mismatch.

4. Key Assumptions Made  
• Skills are inherently multidimensional rather than reducible to a single aggregate measure.  
• The accumulation of skills is contingent on their use in jobs, while lack of use leads to skill depreciation.  
• Workers actively search and sort into jobs based on their skill profile and job requirements, implying a strategic matching process.  
• The valuation of lifetime output depends on both initial skill conditions and dynamic career shocks, requiring the model to account for these interactions explicitly.

5. Estimation or Solution Techniques  
• The model is estimated structurally using the combined datasets from O*NET and the NLSY79.  
• Structural estimation techniques are applied to recover the underlying preferences and technology of skill accumulation and depreciation.  
• Estimation likely involves simulation-based methods or maximum likelihood techniques tailored to structural models, enabling the authors to quantify the consequences of multidimensional mismatches in the labor market.

6. Robustness Checks or Sensitivity Analyses Performed  
• The authors conduct analyses to check the sensitivity of their findings, particularly highlighting deficiencies in models that assume a unidimensional notion of skills.  
• Robustness checks involve comparing outcomes and decomposing the sources of variation in lifetime output under different specifications (multidimensional versus unidimensional) to ensure that the multidimensional framework provides a better explanation of observed labor market phenomena.

This concise summary captures the core methodological approach of the paper, emphasizing the integration of structural modeling with rich, multidimensional data to explore sorting and human capital dynamics.

[Timestamp: 2025/04/01 20:02:07]

**ai**: Below is a structured summary of the paper along with a detailed section discussing how the authors classify multidimensional skills.

──────────────────────────────
1. Overview

• The paper develops a structural on‐the‐job search model in which workers differ along several skill dimensions.  
• Workers accumulate skills through task-specific learning, while unused skills depreciate over time.  
• By combining O*NET data (which provides detailed occupational skill requirements) with the NLSY79 panel (which tracks worker outcomes), the authors quantify the degree and costs of skill mismatch across cognitive, manual, and interpersonal dimensions.  
• The study highlights the limitations of unidimensional models that collapse heterogeneous skills into a single index when analyzing lifetime output differences.

──────────────────────────────
2. Introduction and Motivation

• Traditional labor market models tend to measure human capital along a single dimension.  
• However, real-world skills are multifaceted; workers may have strengths in areas like abstract problem-solving, manual tasks, or interpersonal communication.  
• The paper’s motivation is to capture these nuances to better understand wage variation, occupational switching, and overall productivity.  
• A key question they address: How do different adjustment speeds and return profiles across skill types affect worker outcomes and the cost of mismatch?

──────────────────────────────
3. Theoretical Model

• The authors construct a dynamic model of job search where worker skills and job requirements are multidimensional.  
• Workers are characterized by a skill bundle, typically defined as:  
  x = (x_C, x_M, x_I, x_T),  
  where x_C denotes cognitive skills, x_M manual skills, x_I interpersonal skills, and x_T general efficiency.  
• Jobs are similarly specified by requirements along the major dimensions (typically y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)).  
• The model assumes that when matched, workers’ specialized skills adjust toward the job’s requirements at speeds that differ between upward adjustments (when the job demands exceed a worker’s current skill) and downward adjustments (when the worker is overqualified).  
• The match outcome, wage determination, and on-the-job skill accumulation are derived from equilibrium conditions that incorporate search frictions and renegotiation dynamics with heterogeneous job offers.

──────────────────────────────
4. Empirical Strategy and Data

• The model is estimated by directly linking worker-level NLSY79 data with occupation-level measures from O*NET.  
• O*NET data provide rich detail on skill requirements for occupations, allowing the authors to map job tasks directly onto the corresponding dimensions of worker skills.  
• The estimation strategy relies on identifying the parameters that govern:
 – The rate of skill accumulation (learning-by-doing) and depreciation.
 – The returns to each type of skill and the behavioral responses in occupational switching.
 – The impact of skill mismatch on both wages and employment transitions.

──────────────────────────────
5. Results and Findings

• The paper shows that the economic returns to cognitive skills are significantly higher than those to manual or interpersonal skills, though cognitive skills adjust more slowly.  
• In contrast, manual skills adjust rapidly, leading to moderate wage returns, while interpersonal skills are relatively fixed over a career.  
• The cost of a mismatch is asymmetric: Under-qualification (especially in cognitive skills) imposes a much higher cost than over-qualification.  
• Decompositions of lifetime output reveal that unobserved heterogeneity is overstated in unidimensional models, and career shocks play a substantial role in shaping outcomes.

──────────────────────────────
6. Policy Implications and Conclusions

• The multidimensional approach suggests that policy interventions aimed at reducing skill mismatch should be tailored to specific skill areas rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all human capital variable.  
• The results offer insights into how training, job placement, and labor policies might better accommodate the diversity in skills, potentially improving wage outcomes and productivity.

──────────────────────────────
7. Detailed View: Classifying Multidimensional Skills

In the paper, the authors adopt a rigorous method to classify and quantify multidimensional skills. The key elements of their approach are as follows:

a) Identification of Skill Dimensions  
 – They isolate three key skill dimensions: cognitive (x_C), manual (x_M), and interpersonal (x_I).  
 – An additional component, general efficiency (x_T), captures productivity gains that are not inherently tied to the specific tasks.  
 – These dimensions are motivated by both economic theory (where different tasks require different skills) and practical evidence from occupational databases such as O*NET.

b) Mapping Job Requirements to Skill Dimensions  
 – Jobs are represented by a vector y = (y_C, y_M, y_I) that quantifies the intensity required in each skill category.  
 – O*NET provides a detailed description of occupational tasks, enabling the calibration of these production-related skill weights.  
 – This mapping allows the model to consider how well a worker’s skill vector matches the job’s requirements, thereby generating a measure of “skill mismatch.”

c) Skill Accumulation and Adjustment Process  
 – The evolution of a worker’s specialized skills is modeled using a linear adjustment equation:
  ẋ_k = γ^u_k · max{y_k − x_k, 0} + γ^o_k · min{y_k − x_k, 0}, for each skill type k ∈ {C, M, I}.  
 – Here, γ^u_k and γ^o_k are adjustment speeds capturing the rate of learning (when underqualified) and decay (when overqualified) respectively.  
 – This formulation ensures that when there is a gap between current skill and job requirement, the worker’s skill will converge over time to that requirement, while also depicting a slower adjustment when excess skill is present.

d) Integration into the Production Function  
 – The authors define a production function f(x, y) that incorporates the worker’s general efficiency x_T multiplied by a composite of the rest of the skill dimensions.  
 – It consists of linear terms (α_k y_k) that represent the inherent productivity levels across skill types, as well as quadratic penalty terms (–κ^u_k min{x_k − y_k, 0}^2) which account for the loss in output due to shortages in skills.  
 – This precise specification allows the model to capture different returns across the three dimensions, emphasizing that underqualification in cognitive skills, for example, has a larger negative impact compared to the other dimensions.

e) Estimation Strategy  
 – The model leverages panel data (NLSY79) to estimate the persistence and evolution of workers’ skills over time.  
 – Simulated moments from the model are matched to empirical moments related to occupational mobility, wage profiles, and observed mismatches derived from the O*NET measures.  
 – By fitting these moments, the adjustment speeds (γ^u_k and γ^o_k) and the production function parameters are jointly estimated, quantifying how workers learn on the job and how mismatch translates into wage penalties.

This detailed framework for classifying multidimensional skills is central to the paper’s contribution. It not only provides a clear link between occupational task requirements and worker skill evolution but also allows for a nuanced understanding of how specific skill deficiencies translate into economic costs and affect long-term career trajectories.

# Multidimensional Skills, Sorting, and Human Capital Accumulation

[Open in Zotero](zotero://select/items/@lise2020)

## Abstract
We construct a structural model of on-the-job search in which workers differ in skills along several dimensions and sort themselves into jobs with heterogeneous skill requirements along those same dimensions. Skills are accumulated when used, and depreciate when not used. We estimate the model combining data from O*NET with the NLSY79. We use the model to shed light on the origins and costs of mismatch along heterogeneous skill dimensions. We highlight the deficiencies of relying on a unidimensional model of skill when decomposing the sources of variation in the value of lifetime output between initial conditions and career shocks. (JEL J24, J41, J64)

## Summary

### 1. Overview
- **Model Focus:** Develops a dynamic on-the-job search model where workers possess multidimensional skills.
- **Skill Dynamics:** Skills accumulate with use and depreciate when not used.
- **Data Integration:** Combines detailed occupational data from O*NET and individual-level data from NLSY79.
- **Policy Relevance:** Sheds light on the cost of skill mismatches across cognitive, manual, and interpersonal dimensions.

### 2. Introduction and Motivation
- **Traditional Approach:** Most models use a unidimensional measure of human capital, oversimplifying the actual diversity of skills.
- **Multifaceted Skills:** Recognizes that workers have varied strengths—such as abstract problem-solving, manual abilities, and interpersonal skills.
- **Core Questions:** Explores how differing rates of skill adjustment across dimensions affect wages, job matching, and overall productivity.

### 3. Theoretical Model
- **Worker and Job Representation:** 
  - Workers are represented by a skill bundle $x = (x_C, x_M, x_I, x_T)$, where:
    - $x_C$: Cognitive skills
    - $x_M$: Manual skills
    - $x_I$: Interpersonal skills
    - $x_T$: General efficiency
  - Jobs are represented by $y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)$, capturing skill requirements.
- **Skill Dynamics:** 
  - Skills adjust on-the-job:
    - **Underqualification:** If $x_k < y_k$, skills increase at rate $\gamma^u_k$.
    - **Overqualification:** If $x_k > y_k$, skills may depreciate at rate $\gamma^o_k$.
- **Wage Determination:** Based on surplus sharing between workers and firms, accounting for search frictions and renegotiation dynamics.

### 4. Empirical Strategy and Data
- **Data Sources:** 
  - **O*NET:** Provides detailed occupational skill requirements.
  - **NLSY79:** Offers individual-level panel data on workers.
- **Parameter Estimation:** 
  - Estimates rates of skill accumulation (learning-by-doing) and depreciation.
  - Calibrates returns for each skill dimension.
  - Captures how mismatches impact wages and occupational mobility.

### 5. Results and Findings
- **Differential Returns:**
  - **Cognitive Skills:** High returns but slow to adjust.
  - **Manual Skills:** Moderate returns with rapid on-the-job adjustment.
  - **Interpersonal Skills:** Relatively fixed over a career.
- **Mismatch Costs:** 
  - Costs for underqualification, especially in cognitive skills, are significantly higher compared to overqualification.
- **Model Implications:** 
  - Unidimensional models overstate unobserved heterogeneity.
  - Career shocks play a significant role in shaping lifetime output.

### 6. Detailed View: Classifying Multidimensional Skills

#### a) Identification of Skill Dimensions
- The authors isolate three primary dimensions:
  - **Cognitive ($x_C$)**
  - **Manual ($x_M$)**
  - **Interpersonal ($x_I$)**
- An additional **General Efficiency ($x_T$)** is included to capture overall productivity gains not tied to the specific tasks.

#### b) Mapping Job Requirements to Skill Dimensions
- Jobs are characterized by a vector $y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)$.
- **O*NET Data:** 
  - Provides quantitative measures of required skill intensity for each occupation.
  - Enables precise mapping between job tasks and worker skill dimensions.
- This mapping forms the basis for measuring "skill mismatch" between a worker's abilities and job requirements.

#### c) Skill Accumulation and Adjustment Process
- **Adjustment Equation:**
  $$
  \dot{x}_k = \gamma^u_k \cdot \max\{y_k - x_k, 0\} + \gamma^o_k \cdot \min\{y_k - x_k, 0\}, \quad k \in \{C, M, I\}.
  $$
- **Interpretation:**
  - When $x_k < y_k$, the skill improves at a rate proportional to $\gamma^u_k$ (learning).
  - When $x_k > y_k$, the skill decays at a rate proportional to $\gamma^o_k$ (depreciation).
- This mechanism ensures that, over time, a worker’s skill set converges toward the job’s requirements while capturing the different speeds of adjustment across skill types.

#### d) Integration into the Production Function
- **Production Function Specification:**
  $$
  f(x,y) = x_T \times \Bigl( \alpha_T + \sum_{k\in\{C,M,I\}} \alpha_k y_k 
  - \kappa^u_k \min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2 + \alpha_k k x_k y_k \Bigr).
  $$
- **Components:**
  - **Linear Terms ($\alpha_k y_k$):** Represent inherent productivity levels.
  - **Quadratic Penalty Terms ($-\kappa^u_k \min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2$):** Capture output losses due to skill shortages.
- This formulation emphasizes that underqualification, especially in cognitive skills, incurs a significant penalty.

#### e) Estimation Strategy
- **Data Matching:** 
  - NLSY79 tracks individual career paths, while O*NET provides job requirements.
- **Moment Matching:** 
  - The authors simulate counterfactual moments (like wage profiles and occupational transitions) and match them with empirical observations.
- **Parameter Calibration:** 
  - Jointly estimates adjustment speeds $\gamma^u_k$, $\gamma^o_k$, and production function parameters.
- This integrated approach provides a robust framework to assess the cost of skill mismatches over the lifecycle.

### 7. Policy Implications and Conclusions
- **Tailored Interventions:** 
  - Policies to reduce mismatch should focus on specific skill areas rather than treating human capital as a single index.
- **Training and Job Placement:** 
  - Insights suggest targeted training initiatives to bridge specific skill gaps, particularly in areas with high mismatch costs.
- **Broader Impacts:** 
  - The model highlights the significance of on-the-job skill accumulation and suggests a rethinking of methods to measure and manage human capital.

### 6. Detailed View: Classifying Multidimensional Skills

#### a) Identification of Skill Dimensions
- **Primary Dimensions:** Cognitive ($x_C$), Manual ($x_M$), and Interpersonal ($x_I$).
- **General Efficiency:** ($x_T$) captures overall productivity not tied to a specific task.

#### b) Mapping Job Requirements to Skill Dimensions
- **Job Vector:** Each job is represented as $y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)$.
- **Utilization of O*NET Data:** Provides detailed, quantitative measures that allow mapping of job tasks directly onto these skill dimensions, forming the basis for quantifying “skill mismatch.”

#### c) Skill Accumulation and Adjustment Process

  $$
  \dot{x}_k = \gamma^u_k \cdot \max\{y_k - x_k, 0\} + \gamma^o_k \cdot \min\{y_k - x_k, 0\}, \quad k \in \{C, M, I\}.
  $$
- **Mechanism:**
  - When a worker is underqualified ($x_k < y_k$), they learn at a rate $\gamma^u_k$.
  - When a worker is overqualified ($x_k > y_k$), skills may decay at a rate $\gamma^o_k$.
- This setup ensures that over time, a worker’s skills adjust toward meeting job requirements at differing speeds.

#### d) Integration into the Production Function
- **Production Function Specification:**
  $$
  f(x,y) = x_T \times \Bigl( \alpha_T + \sum_{k\in\{C,M,I\}} \alpha_k y_k - \kappa^u_k\,\min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2 + \alpha_k\,k\,x_k\,y_k \Bigr).
  $$
- **Interpretation:**
  - The linear terms ($\alpha_k y_k$) reflect inherent productivity tied to each skill.
  - The quadratic penalty terms ($-\kappa^u_k \min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2$) capture the losses due to skill shortages, particularly highlighting the costliness of cognitive underqualification.

#### e) Estimation Strategy
- **Data Matching:** The merging of NLSY79 career data with O*NET occupational metrics.
- **Moment Matching:** Model-simulated moments (wage profiles, job transitions) are aligned with empirical observations to estimate:
  - The learning (accumulation) rates $\gamma^u_k$.
  - The depreciation (decay) rates $\gamma^o_k$.
  - Production function parameters.
- This comprehensive strategy quantifies how specific skill mismatches influence wages and career trajectories.

### 7. Policy Implications and Conclusions
- **Targeted Interventions:** Suggests designing policy measures that address specific skill deficiencies instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach to human capital.
- **Practical Insights:** Emphasizes the need for tailored training programs and job placement strategies that mitigate the costs of mismatch and enhance productivity.
- **Overall Impact:** The multidimensional approach provides deeper insights into career dynamics and wage determination, prompting a rethinking of traditional human capital models.

## Construction of Skill Measures

The paper constructs skill measures using a multi-step process that integrates both occupational data and dynamic adjustment mechanisms. Key details include:

### 1. Identification of Skill Dimensions
- **Primary Skill Dimensions:**  
  - Cognitive skills ($x_C$)  
  - Manual skills ($x_M$)  
  - Interpersonal skills ($x_I$)  
- **General Efficiency:**  
  - Represented as ($x_T$), it captures overall productivity gains not tied to specific tasks.

### 2. Mapping Job Requirements to Skill Dimensions
- **Job Requirements Vector:**  
  - Each job is characterized by a vector $y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)$.
- **Data Source – O*NET:**  
  - Provides detailed, quantitative measures of occupational skill requirements.
  - These measures allow for a precise mapping of job tasks onto the corresponding skill dimensions.
- **Skill Mismatch:**  
  - The difference between a worker’s skill vector $x$ and a job’s requirement vector $y$ forms the basis for measuring “skill mismatch.”

### 3. Skill Accumulation and Adjustment Process
- **Dynamic Adjustment Equation:**
  $$
  \dot{x}_k = \gamma^u_k \cdot \max\{y_k - x_k, 0\} + \gamma^o_k \cdot \min\{y_k - x_k, 0\}, \quad k \in \{C, M, I\}
  $$
  - **Underqualification:**  
    - When $x_k < y_k$, skills accumulate at a rate $\gamma^u_k$, capturing the learning-by-doing process.
  - **Overqualification:**  
    - When $x_k > y_k$, skills depreciate at a rate $\gamma^o_k$, reflecting decay when skills are underused.
- **Purpose:**  
  - This mechanism ensures that over time, a worker’s skills will adjust toward the job’s requirements at different speeds depending on whether they are learning or experiencing decay.

### 4. Integration into the Production Function
- **Production Function Specification:**
  $$
  f(x,y) = x_T \times \Bigl( \alpha_T + \sum_{k\in\{C,M,I\}} \alpha_k y_k - \kappa^u_k\,\min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2 + \alpha_k\,k\,x_k\,y_k \Bigr)
  $$
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Linear Terms ($\alpha_k y_k$):**  
    Reflect the productivity contribution of matching each skill category.
  - **Quadratic Penalty Terms ($-\kappa^u_k \min\{x_k - y_k, 0\}^2$):**  
    Capture the losses in output due to skill shortages, especially emphasizing the high cost of underqualification in cognitive skills.
- **Overall:**  
  - The production function explicitly links the constructed skill measures with worker productivity, thereby quantifying the impact of skill deficits.

### 5. Estimation Strategy for Skill Measures
- **Data Matching:**  
  - Combines NLSY79 individual-level data with occupation-level O*NET metrics.
- **Moment Matching Technique:**  
  - Simulated moments (such as wage profiles and job transition frequencies) derived from the model are matched to empirical moments to estimate:
    - The learning (accumulation) rates $\gamma^u_k$.
    - The depreciation (decay) rates $\gamma^o_k$.
    - Parameters of the production function.
- **Outcome:**  
  - This strategy produces quantitative measures of worker skills that evolve over the career, allowing for a detailed analysis of the costs associated with skill mismatches across different dimensions.

## 4.1 Construction of the Skill Requirement Vector

In Section 4.1, the authors detail how they compute the skill requirement vector, y, for each occupation using O*NET data. The process can be summarized in the following steps:

### 1. Extraction of O*NET Descriptors
- **Relevance Identification:**  
  Identify the set of O*NET descriptors that best capture the key skill dimensions—typically cognitive, manual, and interpersonal skills.
- **Variable Selection:**  
  Choose quantitative measures such as task complexity, activity importance, and specific skill ratings from the O*NET database.

### 2. Aggregation of Raw Measures
- **Grouping by Skill Dimension:**  
  Organize the selected descriptors into groups corresponding to each dimension:
  - **Cognitive Requirements ($y_C$):**  
    Variables related to problem-solving, information processing, reasoning, etc.
  - **Manual Requirements ($y_M$):**  
    Measures of physical demands, motor skills, and dexterity.
  - **Interpersonal Requirements ($y_I$):**  
    Indicators of communication, teamwork, and interaction with others.
- **Composite Score Formation:**  
  For each group, compute a composite score that represents the overall requirement level for that dimension. This is typically achieved through:
  - **Averaging or Weighted Averaging:**  
    Each descriptor may be normalized and then aggregated, often using weights derived from prior literature or calibration exercises.
  - **Dimensional Reduction Techniques:**  
    In some cases, factor analysis or principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to distill multiple descriptors into a single score per dimension.

### 3. Normalization and Standardization
- **Adjusting for Heterogeneity:**  
  Normalize the computed scores to ensure comparability across occupations. This involves standardizing the composite scores to have common units or scale.
- **Calibration to Data:**  
  The normalized scores are further calibrated to align with observed occupational outcomes in the NLSY79. This helps ensure that the computed vectors are consistent with real-world metrics of job requirements.

### 4. Constructing the Final Skill Requirement Vector
- **Assembly of the Vector y:**  
  Once the composite scores for cognitive, manual, and interpersonal dimensions are computed and standardized, they are assembled into the vector:  
  $$
  y = (y_C, y_M, y_I)
  $$
- **Use in the Model:**  
  This vector y is then used in the structural model to assess the matching between a worker’s skill bundle and the corresponding job requirements. The degree of mismatch is computed as the difference between a worker’s skill vector and the job’s requirement vector, which then feeds into the analysis of wage dynamics and career progression.

### 5. Technical Considerations
- **Measurement Error:**  
  The authors account for potential errors in O*NET’s self-reported or aggregated measures by cross-validating with external benchmarks or using statistical corrections during estimation.
- **Employment Heterogeneity:**  
  Additional controls may be incorporated to adjust for occupational heterogeneity—ensuring that the requirements vector accurately reflects the task intensity across diverse industries or job types.

This detailed procedure allows the authors to systematically compute the occupation-specific skill requirement vector, which is a crucial input for quantifying skill mismatches and analyzing their implications in the labor market.

**user**: correct me if i'm wrong but the estimated skill vector is at the occupation level, how do the authors estimate the wokrer skill bundle to compute mismatch?
[Timestamp: 2025/04/01 21:31:36]

**ai**: You're correct that the occupation-level skill vector, y, is derived from O*NET data. In contrast, the workers' skill bundle, x, is estimated using individual-level information from the NLSY79. Here's how the authors accomplish this:

1. Pre-market Measurements:  
   - They utilize a rich set of pre-market indicators—such as standardized test scores, educational background, and survey responses—that capture various facets of a worker's abilities.  
   - These measures serve as proxies for the underlying cognitive, manual, and interpersonal skills at labor market entry.

2. Constructing the Initial Skill Bundle:  
   - Using the available pre-market data, they statistically estimate each worker’s initial skill endowment, denoted by $x = (x_C, x_M, x_I, x_T)$.
   - The estimation aggregates multiple observed indicators to form composite measures for the different skill dimensions.

3. Dynamic Evolution Through On-the-Job Learning:  
   - Once the initial skills are set, the model incorporates a learning-by-doing mechanism.  
   - As workers progress in their careers, their skills adjust toward the job's requirements at different speeds, capturing both accumulation (when underqualified) and depreciation (when overqualified).

4. Matching Worker and Occupation-Level Data:  
   - The worker skill bundle from the NLSY79 is linked with the occupation-level requirement vector from O*NET.  
   - This matching process enables the computation of "mismatch" as the difference between a worker's skill vector, x, and the job’s requirement vector, y.

5. Estimation via Moment Matching:  
   - The dynamic evolution parameters (learning and decay rates) and the initial skill measures are jointly estimated by matching simulated model moments (e.g., wage profiles, job transitions) with those observed in the NLSY79 data.
   - This approach ensures that the estimated worker skills are consistent with both pre-market characteristics and on-the-job trajectories.

In summary, while the O*NET data provides skill requirements at the occupation level, the worker-specific skill bundle is built from pre-market data in the NLSY79 and dynamically updated using the on-the-job learning mechanism within the structural model. This integration is critical for assessing the degree of mismatch between a worker’s skills and job requirements.
